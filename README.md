# Image-Processing-Library
COP290 Project
Task1: Create a small image processing library

 First implemented following four functions.
 1-   convolution of a square input matrix and a square kernel, both matrices of any size and the kernel smaller than the input
       -> with and without input padding to maintain or reduce the size of the input matrix
       -> implement the function both as convolution and as matrix multiplication
 2-   non-linear activations of an input matrix of any size with relu and tanh functions on individual matrix elements.
 3-   subsampling of square input matrices of any size with max pooling and average pooling functions
 4-   converting a vector of random floats to a vector of probabilities with softmax and sigmoid functions
